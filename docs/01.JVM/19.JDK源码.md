### LinkedList.get(index)优化, 如index在前半段，从前遍历，否则从后遍历


```java
    Node<E> node(int index) {
        // 如index在前半段，从前遍历，否则从后遍历
        if (index < (size >> 1)) {
            Node<E> x = first;
            for (int i = 0; i < index; i++)
                x = x.next;
            return x;
        } else {
            Node<E> x = last;
            for (int i = size - 1; i > index; i--)
                x = x.prev;
            return x;
        }
    }
```

### 线程池runWorker中的finally负责回收多余的线程
```java
/**
     * Performs cleanup and bookkeeping for a dying worker. Called
     * only from worker threads. Unless completedAbruptly is set,
     * assumes that workerCount has already been adjusted to account
     * for exit.  This method removes thread from worker set, and
     * possibly terminates the pool or replaces the worker if either
     * it exited due to user task exception or if fewer than
     * corePoolSize workers are running or queue is non-empty but
     * there are no workers.
     *
     * @param w the worker
     * @param completedAbruptly if the worker died due to user exception
     */
    private void processWorkerExit(Worker w, boolean completedAbruptly) {
        if (completedAbruptly) // If abrupt, then workerCount wasn't adjusted
            decrementWorkerCount();

        final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
        mainLock.lock();
        try {
            completedTaskCount += w.completedTasks;
            workers.remove(w);
        } finally {
            mainLock.unlock();
        }

        tryTerminate();

        int c = ctl.get();
        if (runStateLessThan(c, STOP)) {
            if (!completedAbruptly) {
                int min = allowCoreThreadTimeOut ? 0 : corePoolSize;
                if (min == 0 && ! workQueue.isEmpty())
                    min = 1;
                if (workerCountOf(c) >= min)
                    return; // replacement not needed
            }
            addWorker(null, false);
        }
    }
```
